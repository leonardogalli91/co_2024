\title{Ideas for Exercises}
\date{}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\noindent Strong suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Proof of Lemma 1.11 and Lemma 1.12 from \cite{beck14a} (Lemma 2.2 and Corollary 2.1 from Chapter 1 of my notes). \checkmark  
    \item Example 2.5 from \cite{beck14a}, give the analytical form of the function, without plotting it and ask to find and classify all minima and maxima. \checkmark (Sheet 03, Problem 1)
    \item Proof of Theorem 2.17 from \cite{beck14a} (Theorem 3.2  from Chapter 1 of  my notes). \checkmark (Sheet 03, Exercise 1)
    \item Proof of Theorem 2.27 from \cite{beck14a} (Theorem 3.4  from Chapter 1 of  my notes). \checkmark (Sheet 03, Exercise 2)
    \item Proof of Theorem 2.29 from \cite{beck14a} (Theorem 3.5  from Chapter 1 of  my notes). \checkmark (Sheet 04, Problem 2)
    \item Compute the Lipschitz constant of some known functions (e.g., linear, quadratic, page 73 of \cite{beck14a})  \checkmark (Sheet 05)
    \item Proof of $(a)\Rightarrow(b)$ of Theorem 4.20 from \cite{beck14a} (Theorem 2.1  from Chapter 2 of my notes) \checkmark (Sheet 05, Exercise 1)
    \item I will not cover exact line searches, so maybe you could prove Lemma 4.24 in the case of exact line searches and Lemma 4.7 from \cite{beck14a}  \checkmark (Sheet 06)
    \item Prove of Theorem 4.25 (convergence of GD (only with Armijo line search)) from \cite{beck14a} when $f\in $C$^1(\mathbb{R}^n)$ instead of $f\in $C$^{1,1}_L(\mathbb{R}^n)$
    \checkmark (Sheet 06)
    \item Prove R-linear convergence for Barzilai-Borwein method for quadratic functions when $\lambda_n<2\lambda_1$ (the proof is in Lemma 2.1 from \cite{dai02a})
    \item Lemma 4.10 (Kantorovich inequality) and Lemma 4.11 from \cite{beck14a} are also quite related to Proposition 2.1 from Chpater 2 of my notes 
    \item Theorem 7.6 from \cite{beck14a} (Theorem 2.1 from Chapter 3 of my notes)
    \item Lemma 9.11 of \cite{beck14a} (Lemma 3.1 from Chapter 3 of my notes)
    %\item I will cover the proof of Gordanâ€™s theorem of the alternative (Theorem 10.4 from \cite{beck14a}) nor Farkas' Lemma (Theorem 10.3)
\end{itemize}
Weak suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prove that the nuclear norm is actually a norm.
    \item Characterization of matrices based on their diagonal values (e.g., Lemma 2.12 and 2.16 from \cite{beck14a}).  \checkmark
    \item An exercise applying a nonmonotone GD to the Rosenbrock function (Example 4.13 from \cite{beck14a})
    \item In the constrained case, I am leaving out the line search, so Lemma 9.12 and Lemma 9.13 but also Section 9.4.2 from \cite{beck14a} could be exercises 
\end{itemize}
